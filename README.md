For regenerating all the figures from the manuscript, follow the subsequent steps:

1. Download and pre-process all the ATAC, RNA, Chipseq (narrow) and Chispeq broad data using seq2science (0.7.1). All necisary sample and config files are present in the respective 'data' folders. Change the path to the fastq directory and other settings where needed for your specific setup. For more information regarding running seq2science, see: https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/seq2science
